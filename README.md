# POC_SQL_DATA_MOCKER
Proof of concept - Sql Data Mock generator.

Reads a format file defining a data structure then outputs records filled with mock data in .csv style.  As this is just a proof of concept only varchar and int datatypes will be supported and content of output will be purely random instead of having various defined generators like Name or car_type for varchar, etc.
